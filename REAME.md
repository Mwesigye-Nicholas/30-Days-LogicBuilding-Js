# 30 Days of Logic Building in JavaScript

Welcome to the "30 Days of Logic Building in JavaScript" project! This initiative is designed to enhance my problem-solving skills and understanding of JavaScript through daily exercises. Each day focuses on a specific concept or challenge to incrementally build your logical thinking and coding expertise taken from coddy.tech site.

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Strengthen my coding and logic-building skills in JavaScript over 30 days.
- **Duration:** 30 days, with one exercise or challenge per day.
- **Format:** Each day includes a challenge, potential solutions, and space for personal notes.

## Daily Challenges

Each day's challenge will focus on different aspects of JavaScript, including but not limited to:

1. **Day 1: Basics of Variables and Data Types**
   - Understanding `let`, `const`, and `var`.
   - Practice with different data types: strings, numbers, booleans, etc.

2. **Day 2: Control Structures**
   - Implementing `if` statements and `switch` cases.
   - Basic conditional logic exercises.

3. **Day 3: Loops**
   - Understanding `for`, `while`, and `do while` loops.
   - Practical exercise to iterate over arrays.

4. **Day 4: Functions**
   - Writing and using functions in JavaScript.
   - Arrow functions and anonymous functions.

5. **Day 5: Arrays**
   - Methods to manipulate arrays: `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, etc.
   - Iterate through arrays with methods such as `forEach`.

6. **Day 6: Objects**
   - Understanding object literals and properties.
   - Exercises to manipulate and access object data.

7. **Day 7-30:** 
   - Advanced topics including higher-order functions, asynchronous JavaScript, ES6 features, and problem-solving algorithms.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of JavaScript.
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).
- Node.js installed for running JavaScript outside the browser (optional).
